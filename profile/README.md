## 👾 Our Mission

**Dot Matrix Labs** is building the sovereign stack for the agentic future. We believe in:
1.  **Local-First Intelligence**: Your context, memory, and agency should live on your machine.
2.  **Modular Autonomy**: AI shouldn't be a black box; it should be a factory of specialized, observable agents.
3.  **High-Performance Infrastructure**: Rust-based, self-healing systems that run at the speed of thought.

## 🛠️ Project Summaries

### [🔮 Facet](https://github.com/dot-matrix-labs/facet)
> **"Just as the Browser unbundled the OS from the Web, Facet unbundles Memory from the Model."**

Facet is the **Context OS** that sits between you and the AI.
- **Problem**: "Mystery Meat" profiles and platform fragmentation.
- **Solution**: A neutral, trusted layer where you control your context.
- **Tech**: Built in Rust 🦀 with a Tauri frontend and SurrealDB graph store.

### [🌙 Nightshift](https://github.com/dot-matrix-labs/nightshift)
> **"We want agents to work overnight, and the factory must not catch fire."**

Nightshift is a protocol for **Autonomous Software Factories**.
- **Git-Brain**: Commits are a "Reasoning Ledger".
- **Nags**: Quality gates that agents must pass.
- **Deep Context**: A "Documentation Fractal" for self-orienting agents.

### [🤖 Robert](https://github.com/dot-matrix-labs/robert-desktop)
> **"Privacy-first AI automation that keeps your data local and your options open."**

Robert is a web browser designed for the age of agents.
- **Local Data**: History, cookies, and context never leave your machine.
- **Vendor Neutral**: Switch between Claude, GPT, or local models instantly.
- **Visual**: Watch agents browse and automate tasks in real-time.

### [🔥 Inferno](https://github.com/dot-matrix-labs/inferno)
> **"A self-healing cloud for AI inference."**

Inferno is an end-to-end Rust LLM platform.
- **Performance**: Zero-allocation request handling.
- **Reliability**: SWIM protocol for self-healing discovery.
- **Safety**: Pure Rust stack, eliminating memory safety vulnerabilities.
