## Our Mission

**Dot Matrix Labs** builds infrastructure for the multi-agent future. We believe the next era of software will be written by constellations of AI agents—not locked to a single vendor, but orchestrated across providers. Our tools make that future possible.

### What We Build

1. **Vendor-Neutral Agent Infrastructure**: Switch between Claude, GPT, local models, or any provider. Your workflows and context stay portable.

2. **Rust-Powered Performance**: Every core system is built in Rust for memory safety, zero-allocation hot paths, and self-healing reliability.

3. **Agent-First Tooling**: New workflows require new tools. We're building the browsers, memory systems, and factories designed from the ground up for autonomous agents.

```text
 _ __ _ ____ ____ ____ __ _ ____
 | | \| |--- |=== |--< | \| [__]
```
> **"A self-healing cloud for AI inference."**

Inferno is an end-to-end **Rust** LLM micro-platform, request-optimized and kernel-optimized.
- **Performance**: Zero-allocation request handling patterns for maximum throughput.
- **Self-Healing**: SWIM protocol for automatic backend discovery and recovery.
- **Pure Rust**: Memory-safe stack eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities.

### [Nightshift](https://github.com/dot-matrix-labs/nightshift)

```
> **"We want agents to work overnight, and the factory must not catch fire."**

Nightshift is a methodology and toolset for **Autonomous Software Factories**.
- **Git-Brain**: Commits are a "Reasoning Ledger" storing prompt and intent for perfect replayability.
- **Multi-Agent**: Use different reasoning providers for what they do best, at the right cost.
- **Deep Context**: A "Documentation Fractal" so agents self-orient without RAG or vector stores.

```
> **"Just as the Browser unbundled the OS from the Web, Facet unbundles Memory from the Model."**

Facet is the **Memory Layer** for AI—a neutral, trusted Context OS.
- **The Problem**: "Mystery Meat" profiles where users can't control what AI "knows."
- **The Solution**: Separate memory from reasoning. Your context stays portable and under your control.
- **GraphRAG**: Knowledge graphs with temporal reasoning, not just keyword search.

> **"Privacy-first AI automation that keeps your data local and your options open."**

Robert is a browser and agent platform with a local knowledge base.
- **Local Knowledge Base**: Your workflows, agent configs, and browsing data stay on your machine.
- **Vendor Neutral**: Use Claude today, GPT tomorrow, local models next week—switch freely.
- **Visual Automation**: Watch agents browse and automate tasks in real-time.
